# MLB Player Salary Estimator

## Project Overview
* First baseball project analyzing the relationship between Run Expectancy per the 24 different base states (RE24), Ultimate Zone Rating per 150 games (UZR/150) for non-catchers, Defensive Runs Above Average (Def) for catchers, and Salary
* Scraped salary data from spotrac.com, looking at veteran and arbitration contracts (only players that have already signed/negotiated contracts)
* Scraped play-by-play data from Retrosheet to calculate RE24 for all batters in the 2019 season
* Downloaded Defensive data from Fangraphs
* Created various linear models to determine how much teams value offense (RE24) vs defense (UZR/150 or DEF) when deciding how much a player is worth
